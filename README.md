# WebscrapingScripts

All webscraping has been conducted using python scripts and the beautifulsoup package.

PBTech Script
---------------------

This scripts finds the ten top selling monitors names along with prices and exports this information into a .csv.

As I had just started learning webscraping and coincidentally at the time was on the look out for a new monitor I decided to scrape the PBTech website.

None of this information was used maliciously.


Zomato Script
---------------------

This script finds the Name, Location, Cost for Two and Rating for resterauns within Auckland and then exports the information into a .csv.

At the time my intention was to determine the relationship between Cost for Two and the Ratings.

As I have recently found out Zomato has changed their web design I intend on creating a updated script and conducting this analysis.

None of this information was used maliciously.
